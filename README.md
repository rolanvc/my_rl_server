# My (own) Reinforcement Learning Playground Server
The purpose of this is for me to be able to perform experiments on RL, specifically, on Multi-agent RL.
It seems to me the best way to do this is to create a playground server, and just have different RL agents connect to it to play/interact either in  cooperative or competitive modes.
